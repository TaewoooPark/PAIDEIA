# Vision-based PDF extraction (default for all course materials)

Supplemental to `SKILL.md`. **This is the pipeline `/paideia:ingest` uses for every PDF in `materials/**`** — lectures, textbook, homework, and solutions alike.

`pdfplumber` was tried first as a "fast path" for prose-heavy material but proved unreliable on course content: even textbook pages that look like plain prose silently word-salad when they mix in equations, figures, multi-column layouts, or margin notes. Instead of maintaining a per-category heuristic with fallbacks that we'd need to retune for every course, we route everything through the same vision pipeline. It's slower, but reliable, and the wall-time cost is absorbed by parallelism (one agent per PDF).

## What `pdfplumber` gets wrong

Typical failure modes, any one of which is enough to justify skipping digital extraction:
- Equations fragmented: operators on one line, operands on the next
- Variables and subscripts on separate lines
- Multi-column content interleaved into alternating rows
- Greek letters preserved but structure (fractions, integrals, bras/kets, sums, vectors) lost
- Figure captions fused into adjacent body text
- Margin notes or headers/footers injected mid-paragraph
- Markdown looks like a bag-of-tokens dump despite the PDF being "digital"

These failures are silent — the extraction completes, the file gets written, and you only notice when `/paideia:analyze` tries to build patterns out of garbage. By the time you catch it, the downstream course-index is already poisoned. Vision avoids the failure mode entirely.

## Pipeline

```
materials/<cat>/X.pdf
    ├─(pdf2image, dpi=160)→  converted/<cat>/_pages/X/p01..pNN.png
    ├─(PIL resize, ≤1800px)→ (in-place)
    └─(parallel Agent per file, vision Read of PNGs)→ converted/<cat>/X.md
```

One agent per PDF, spawned in parallel. Each agent handles only its own file's page images — no cross-file writes — so they don't step on each other. For a 13-lecture course this gives ~4–7 min wall time instead of hours of serial work.

## Step 1 — Render pages to PNG

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from pathlib import Path

imgs = convert_from_path("materials/lectures/Lecture1.pdf", dpi=160)
out = Path("converted/lectures/_pages/Lecture1"); out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
for i, im in enumerate(imgs, 1):
    im.save(out / f"p{i:02d}.png", "PNG", optimize=True)
```

`dpi=160` is the sweet spot: readable math, reasonable file size. Lower and sub/superscripts blur; higher just burns disk.

## Step 2 — Enforce the 2000px ceiling

**Critical constraint.** Claude's many-image requests reject any image whose long edge exceeds ~2000 px with:

> An image in the conversation exceeds the dimension limit for many-image requests (2000px). Run /compact to remove old images from context, or start a new session.

Slide decks at `dpi=160` rendered from 16:9 PDFs routinely produce 4267×2400 PNGs, which blows past that. Downscale **before** any vision agent starts reading, to max 1800 px long edge (safety margin under 2000):

```python
from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path

MAX = 1800
for png in Path("converted/lectures/_pages").rglob("*.png"):
    im = Image.open(png); w, h = im.size
    if max(w, h) <= MAX:
        continue
    scale = MAX / max(w, h)
    im.resize((int(w*scale), int(h*scale)), Image.LANCZOS).save(png, "PNG", optimize=True)
```

If an agent started before the resize ran, it will have already captured the oversized image into its context and the request dies on the way to the model — the whole agent-run wastes. **Resize first, agents second.**

## Step 3 — Parallel agents, one per file

Spawn a separate `general-purpose` agent per PDF, in parallel, backgrounded. Each agent handles only its own file's page images — no cross-file work — so they don't race on writes.

### Prompt template

```
You are transcribing a <domain> PDF to clean markdown using vision.
pdfplumber is unreliable on course materials (it splits equations
across lines and interleaves columns), so we render each page and
read it visually.

Input: page images at <abs_path>/_pages/<stem>/p01.png through pNN.png
       (NN pages). Images are ≤1800px on the long edge.
Output: overwrite <abs_path>/<stem>.md

Procedure:
1. Read each page image with the Read tool — **one at a time**, not in
   parallel batches, to stay under the per-request image-dimension budget.
   After reading and transcribing a page, move to the next.
2. Transcribe each page into markdown, preserving the page's reading
   order (not raw column order).
3. Format math in LaTeX: inline $...$, display $$...$$. Render hats,
   hbars, partials, bras/kets, sums, vectors, operators faithfully.
   If a symbol is genuinely unreadable, write [?] — do not guess.
4. Use ## for section/slide titles. Prepend ### Page N anchors so
   downstream tools can cite pages.
5. Preserve bullet hierarchy, numbered postulates/theorems/definitions,
   labeled equations, tables.
6. Skip-mark truly empty pages as *[blank]*.
7. Do NOT summarize — faithfully transcribe only what is on the page.
8. For heavy diagrams, write one italic line *Figure: [description]*
   rather than pixel-wise transcription.

Top of file must be:
<!-- SOURCE: materials/<cat>/<stem>.pdf, extracted <YYYY-MM-DD>, method: vision -->

# <Title>

Write the full file once at the end. Report: page count handled and
any [?] symbols you marked.
```

**Sequential read is non-negotiable.** Even though individual images are under the per-image ceiling, reading many in parallel batches the agent's request and trips the many-image dimension limit again. Instruct the agent explicitly to read → transcribe → next.

## Step 4 — Cleanup

After all agents report done and you've spot-checked the markdown, delete the `_pages/` scratch dirs. These are ~5–25 MB per PDF; they have no downstream use.

```bash
rm -rf converted/*/_pages
```

Leave `_pages/` around only while a re-run is possible — once the markdown is verified, the PNGs are waste.

## Quality notes (from a real course run)

Validated on a 13-lecture Quantum Mechanics course, ~208 pages re-extracted:

- **0 `[?]` markers needed.** At `dpi=160` every equation, subscript, bra-ket, partial derivative, operator hat, and Greek letter was legible.
- Two of the initial agents failed on the oversized-image error because they started reading before the resize pass ran. Resizing preemptively avoided this for every subsequent run — hence Step 2 comes before Step 3.
- Output quality vs `pdfplumber`: equations render as `$$\hat H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\partial_x^2 + V(x)$$` instead of `ℏ ∂ p2 ℏ 2 ∂ 2 p ̂ =  H  = + V ( x )  Ĥ = − + V ( x )`. Night and day.
- Blank final pages are common (title separators, thank-you slides). Agents correctly mark them `*[blank]*`.

Equivalent wins are expected across any math/physics course: linear algebra (matrices, tensor products), E&M (vector calculus, Maxwell's equations), statistical mechanics (partition functions, integrals), discrete math (summations, recurrences, binomial identities), real analysis (limits, ε-δ proofs), complex analysis (contour integrals, residues). Textbook chapters ingest equally cleanly — `pdfplumber`'s "prose is fine" turned out to be false once equations, figures, or multi-column layouts entered the page.

The `<domain>` placeholder in the prompt is the only thing that changes per course — fill it with whatever the course is about (e.g., "quantum mechanics", "discrete mathematics", "real analysis").

## When NOT to use this pipeline

- **Hand-written answer PDFs** — use the `vision-ocr` skill instead. It's tuned for noisy ink, variable layouts, and the error-tolerant strategy-grading downstream. Hand-writing is a different noise profile than printed slides/books.
- **Arbitrary PDFs outside the plugin's scope** (e.g., the user wants a quick text dump, or is merging/splitting PDFs) — use `pdfplumber` / `pypdf` / `pytesseract` per `SKILL.md` for ad-hoc work; the vision pipeline exists specifically for *course-material ingestion into a faithful LaTeX knowledge base*.

## TL;DR

Every `materials/**/*.pdf` → render at `dpi=160` → resize all PNGs to ≤1800 px **before** any agent starts → one agent per PDF in parallel → each agent reads images **sequentially** → clean LaTeX markdown out → `rm -rf converted/*/_pages`.
