name: answer-processing
description: Use whenever the user uploads a hand-written or scanned answer PDF to be graded against a reference solution. Converts answer PDFs in `answers/*.pdf` to markdown in `answers/converted/*.md` using the pdf skill (OCR as needed), then performs strategy-based grading against `converted/solutions/*.md` or `quizzes/*_answers.md`. Invoked by `/grade`.

# Answer Processing

## When to load

- User uploads an answer PDF and asks to grade it
- `/grade` is invoked
- User says "I finished the quiz, here's my work"

## Core pipeline

```
answers/<quiz-name>.pdf      ← user uploads hand-written scan
      ↓ (pdf skill, OCR)
answers/converted/<quiz-name>.md
      ↓ (this skill)
grade report → stdout (compact) + errors/log.md (append)
```

## Step-by-step procedure

### Step 1: Locate the answer file

If `/grade` was called with an argument, use it as a hint. Otherwise find the most recently modified file in `answers/` (not `answers/converted/`).

### Step 2: Convert PDF to MD (if PDF)

**Use the `vision-ocr` skill** — delegates to a local VLM (Qwen3-VL 8B via ollama) for clean Korean+LaTeX transcription, with pytesseract as automatic fallback.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/vision_ocr.py" answers/<name>.pdf answers/converted/<name>.md
```

The script handles model warmup, page-by-page inference, and tier fallback. See `.claude/skills/vision-ocr/SKILL.md`. The output header tells the grader which tier produced the text:

- `<!-- SOURCE: ..., qwen3-vl:8b @ 300dpi, N pages -->` → high-confidence
- `<!-- TIER: tesseract fallback -->` → degraded; treat results conservatively

### Step 3: Graceful handling of OCR noise

Hand-written math OCR will be imperfect. Expect:
- Greek letters misread as Latin ($\alpha \to a$, $\beta \to B$, $\pi \to T$ or $n$)
- Fractions rendered as flattened text ($\tfrac{dU}{dT} \to dUdT$ or similar)
- Subscripts/superscripts lost or inlined

**Do not grade on algebraic correctness of OCR output.** Instead, apply **strategy-based grading**:

### Step 4: Strategy extraction from noisy MD

Read the converted MD file. For each problem, identify:

1. **Which pattern(s) did the user invoke?** Look for:
   - Named theorems / techniques the user wrote out ("Maxwell relation", "Stokes theorem", "by induction")
   - Variables they held fixed (even if notation is mangled)
   - Key intermediate objects (a chosen potential, a change of variable, an ansatz)

2. **Did the reasoning reach the correct end form?** Even if algebra is wrong, the user's final expression structure (Does it have a log? A sqrt? A series? Correct variables?) tells you if the approach worked.

3. **Where did they stop?** Incomplete work is common; note which step is the last recognizable one.

### Step 5: Compare against reference solution

Open the reference (`converted/solutions/<hw>.md` for HW, `quizzes/<name>_answers.md` for quizzes, `twins/<id>_<ts>_sol.md` for twins, `chain/<ts>_sol.md` for chain).

For each problem/part, produce a verdict:

```
## P<n>
- Pattern match: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌   [user invoked <Pk>, solution uses <Pk>]
- Variable choice: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌  [user held <x> fixed, should be <y>]
- End form: ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌          [user's final: <form>, expected: <form>]
- Completeness: <last step user reached>
- Overall: <PASS | PARTIAL | FAIL>
- Note: <one line — what to study, which Pk to re-drill>
```

**Do not** report line-by-line algebra mistakes unless they are specifically about sign errors or notation bugs that matter on the exam (e.g., missing $-$ on $\kappa$ definition, conjugate vs. transpose confusion).

### Step 6: Log errors

For each non-✅ entry, append to `errors/log.md`:

```yaml
- problem_id: <id>
  pattern: <Pk>
  error_type: pattern-missed | wrong-variable | wrong-end-form | algebraic | sign | definition
  summary: "<1 line>"
  source: answers/converted/<name>.md
  date: <ISO>
```

### Step 7: Render grade summary (chat output)

Compact table, no verbose explanations:

```
| Problem | Pattern | Vars | End form | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | ✅ | ✅ | ⚠️ | PARTIAL |
| P2 | ❌ | — | — | FAIL |
| P3 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | PASS |

Dominant issue: pattern-missed on P2 (used brute-force integration; should use residue theorem, P7).
Drill next: /blind <problem testing P7>, or /pattern P7 for quick review.
```

Keep this under 15 lines of output.

## Handling edge cases

### Empty or unreadable PDF
If OCR yields <100 chars total, ask the user:
"OCR 결과가 너무 부족해. PDF 화질이 낮거나 필기가 너무 작을 수도. 옵션:
(a) 더 밝게/크게 스캔해서 다시 업로드
(b) 직접 답을 `.md`로 타이핑해서 `answers/converted/<name>.md`에 저장 후 다시 `/grade`"

### User uploads .md directly
Skip PDF conversion. Read `answers/<name>.md` directly. Everything else is the same.

### Multi-page with disordered content
Hand-written work often has margin notes, arrows, struck-through attempts. OCR will render them chaotically. Note in the grade: "답안 순서가 애매. 내가 이해한 해석: <brief>. 다르면 알려줘."

### User already in context
If the user pastes their work directly into chat (not as PDF), grade it from context. Still apply strategy-based grading.

## Anti-patterns (things NOT to do)

❌ Demand pixel-perfect algebra from OCR output
❌ Mark something wrong because OCR mangled a Greek letter
❌ Require the user to retype their solution in LaTeX
❌ Produce 3-page grade reports (stay compact)
❌ Reveal the reference solution before grading (user might be asking "did I get it right" as a first pass)

## Integration

- Called by `/grade`
- Uses `pdf` skill for OCR
- Reads `course-index/patterns.md` (pattern IDs) and `converted/solutions/` or equivalent
- Writes to `errors/log.md` and `answers/converted/`
