description: Convert all course-material PDFs (lectures, textbook, homework, solutions) to markdown via the vision pipeline — one parallel agent per file, LaTeX-faithful transcription. Idempotent — skips already-converted files.
argument-hint: [--force to reconvert everything]
---

Load `skills/pdf/SKILL.md`, `skills/pdf/VISION.md`, and `skills/course-builder/SKILL.md`.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

## Routing rule

**Every PDF in `materials/**` goes through the vision pipeline.** `pdfplumber` is unreliable in practice on course materials — even prose-heavy textbook pages mix in equations, figures, and multi-column layouts that break digital extraction silently. Rather than maintaining a routing heuristic and a fallback that we'd need to keep tuning per course, we route everything through the same pipeline: render → resize → parallel vision agents → clean LaTeX markdown.

| Source | Method |
|---|---|
| `materials/**/*.pdf` | **Vision pipeline** (render at `dpi=160`, resize ≤1800 px, one parallel `general-purpose` agent per PDF, sequential `Read` inside the agent) |
| `materials/**/*.md` | Copy-through with provenance header |

Hand-written answer PDFs (`answers/*.pdf`) are a separate path — handled by `/paideia:grade`, not `/paideia:ingest`.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Discovery

Scan `materials/` recursively for `.pdf` and `.md`. Classify by subfolder: `lectures`, `textbook`, `homework`, `solutions`. Ambiguous files (PDFs sitting in `materials/` root) get one prompt to categorize.

Apply idempotence: if `converted/<cat>/<stem>.md` exists and is newer than the source, skip — unless `--force` is in `$ARGUMENTS`. Log skip count.

### Step 2 — Copy-through for `.md` sources

For each `.md` already in `materials/`: mirror to `converted/<cat>/<stem>.md` verbatim, adding:

```
<!-- SOURCE: materials/<cat>/<stem>.md, copied <YYYY-MM-DD>, method: passthrough -->
```

### Step 3 — Render all PDFs to PNG at dpi=160

For each PDF that needs conversion:

```python
from pdf2image import convert_from_path
from pathlib import Path

for pdf_path in pdfs_to_convert:
    cat, stem = pdf_path.parent.name, pdf_path.stem
    out = Path(f"converted/{cat}/_pages/{stem}")
    out.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    for i, im in enumerate(convert_from_path(str(pdf_path), dpi=160), 1):
        im.save(out / f"p{i:02d}.png", "PNG", optimize=True)
```

`dpi=160` is the sweet spot: math stays legible, file sizes stay reasonable.

### Step 4 — Resize every PNG to ≤1800 px long edge BEFORE any agent starts

```python
from PIL import Image
from pathlib import Path

MAX = 1800
for png in Path("converted").rglob("_pages/**/*.png"):
    im = Image.open(png); w, h = im.size
    if max(w, h) <= MAX:
        continue
    scale = MAX / max(w, h)
    im.resize((int(w*scale), int(h*scale)), Image.LANCZOS).save(png, "PNG", optimize=True)
```

**This is not optional.** Claude's many-image requests hard-reject images >2000 px on the long edge; 16:9 slides at `dpi=160` produce ~4267×2400 PNGs that blow past that. Any agent that started reading before the resize ran will have already captured the oversized image into its context — its entire run wastes.

### Step 5 — Spawn one `general-purpose` agent per PDF, in parallel, backgrounded

Each agent touches only its own file's `_pages/<stem>/` directory, so writes don't race. Use this prompt template (fill in the bracketed values):

```
You are transcribing a <domain> PDF to clean markdown using vision.
pdfplumber is unreliable on course materials (it splits equations
across lines and interleaves columns), so we render each page and
read it visually.

Input: page images at <abs_path>/_pages/<stem>/p01.png through pNN.png
       (NN pages). Images are ≤1800 px on the long edge.
Output: overwrite <abs_path>/<stem>.md

Procedure:
1. Read each page image with the Read tool — one at a time, not in
   parallel batches, to stay under the per-request image-dimension
   budget. After reading and transcribing a page, move to the next.
2. Transcribe each page into markdown, preserving the page's reading
   order (not raw column order).
3. Format math in LaTeX: inline $...$, display $$...$$. Render hats,
   hbars, partials, bras/kets, sums, vectors, operators faithfully.
   If a symbol is genuinely unreadable, write [?] — do not guess.
4. Use ## for section/slide titles. Prepend ### Page N anchors so
   downstream tools can cite pages.
5. Preserve bullet hierarchy, numbered postulates/theorems/definitions,
   labeled equations, tables.
6. Skip-mark truly empty pages as *[blank]*.
7. Do NOT summarize — faithfully transcribe only what is on the page.
8. For heavy diagrams, write one italic line *Figure: [description]*
   rather than pixel-wise transcription.

Top of file must be:
<!-- SOURCE: materials/<cat>/<stem>.pdf, extracted <YYYY-MM-DD>, method: vision -->

# <Title>

Write the full file once at the end. Report: page count handled and
any [?] symbols you marked.
```

`<domain>` should be whatever the course is about (quantum mechanics, linear algebra, discrete math, real analysis, E&M, etc.) — infer from the materials or ask the user once if unclear.

**Sequential `Read` inside the agent is non-negotiable.** Parallel batches of `Read` calls trip the many-image dimension limit again even though each individual PNG is under the per-image ceiling.

Wait for all agents to report done. Spot-check one or two output files before moving on (equations should read top-to-bottom as coherent LaTeX; page anchors should be present).

### Step 6 — Cleanup

After all agents finish and outputs look sane, delete the `_pages/` scratch directories:

```bash
rm -rf converted/*/_pages
```

These are ~5–25 MB per PDF and have no downstream use. Keep them only if you plan to re-run immediately.

## Summary output

After ingest completes, print:

| Category | Converted | Skipped (already done) | Failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| lectures | N | M | F |
| textbook | ... | ... | ... |
| homework | ... | ... | ... |
| solutions | ... | ... | ... |

End with:
"다음 단계: `/paideia:analyze`로 patterns.md, coverage.md, summary.md를 생성하세요."

If any file failed (encryption, corrupted PDF, agent timeout), list at the end with the specific failure reason and suggested workaround:
- Password-protected PDF → `qpdf --password=... --decrypt in.pdf out.pdf` first
- Agent crashed mid-run → `/paideia:ingest --force` to retry just that file
- Render step OOM on huge PDF → split the PDF first, ingest each half
