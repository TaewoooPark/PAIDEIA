description: Generate a one-page exam cheatsheet from course-index and errors/log.md. Outputs to cheatsheet/final.md. Optionally convert to PDF.
argument-hint: [--pdf to also produce a printable PDF via pdf skill]
---

Load `skills/exam-drill/SKILL.md`. Read `course-index/patterns.md`, `course-index/coverage.md`, `course-index/summary.md`, and `errors/log.md`.

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

Procedure:

1. **Collect highest-value items:**
   - Top 5 patterns by frequency of appearance (from `patterns.md`)
   - All formulas boxed in `derivations/*.md` (final results)
   - User's most-frequent error types (from `errors/log.md`) — with the correction, not the error
   - 🔴 blind-spot sections with one key formula each

2. **Structure the cheatsheet** (target: fits on 1 page @ 10pt):

   ```markdown
   # <Course name> — Cheatsheet

   _Generated <date>. For exam reference only._

   ## Core formulas
   <table or compact list of boxed results from derivations/>

   ## Pattern quick-ref
   | Pk | Recognition | Move |
   |---|---|---|
   ...top 8 patterns only

   ## Traps to remember (from my errors/log)
   - <correction 1>
   - <correction 2>
   ...max 5

   ## Blind-spot formulas (memorize these — no HW drilled them)
   <one formula per blind-spot section, boxed>
   ```

3. **Write to** `cheatsheet/final.md`.

4. **If `--pdf` in arguments:**
   - Load `skills/pdf/SKILL.md`
   - Convert cheatsheet/final.md to `cheatsheet/final.pdf` using reportlab
   - Use 2-column layout, 9pt font, no margins (for maximum density)
   - Remember: NO Unicode subscripts/superscripts in reportlab — use `<sub>`/`<super>` XML tags
   - Use `pypandoc` if available as alternative: `pypandoc.convert_file('final.md', 'pdf', outputfile='final.pdf')`

5. **Print to chat:**
   - Filename of the cheatsheet
   - Word count / rough page estimate
   - Closing: "시험장에 가져갈 수 있는 자료는 강의 규정 확인. 반입 불가면 최소한 이걸 마지막으로 스캔해서 외워."

## Density tips

- Formulas only, no sentences. Everything derivable in your head doesn't belong here.
- Use abbreviations the user will recognize (no first-time notation).
- Group by when-you'll-need-it, not by pedagogical order.
- The "traps" section is disproportionately valuable — it's tailored to the user's specific mistakes.
