## What Paideia means

In ancient Greece, **Παιδεία** was never the deposit of facts into a passive student. It was the lifelong formation of a complete human being — through structured encounter with primary texts, guided practice under a master, and reflective dialogue that folds feedback into deeper revision.

This plugin implements that cycle for the specific, bounded problem of **exam preparation** in math, physics, and engineering courses:

```
  ingest ──▶ analyze ──▶ drill ──▶ grade ──▶ weakmap ──▶ cheatsheet
     ▲                                                        │
     └────────────────── feedback loop ───────────────────────┘
```

Every stage produces a markdown artifact that lives in your course folder forever. Nothing is ephemeral. Nothing is hidden behind an API. Nothing stops working when the next funding winter hits.

---

## What generic study tools can't do

Most study tools can't personalize to *your* course, *your* professor, or *your* mistakes — because the product they sell is a generic curriculum.

- **Coursera, edX, Khan Academy** — fixed curriculum; no idea what your professor actually emphasizes.
- **Quizlet, Anki, Brainscape** — you manually curate every card; nothing derives patterns from your own solution manuals.
- **Chegg, Course Hero** — generic solution manuals; not organized around your course's recurring idioms.
- **Brilliant, Duolingo Max, Khanmigo** — generic exercises; no knowledge of what you got wrong on HW2 last month.
- **ChatGPT Study Mode, Gemini "Deep Study", NotebookLM** — no persistent per-course state. Every new session starts cold, and last week's mistakes don't shape this week's drill unless you re-upload and re-explain.

None of them *form* understanding around the specific material in front of you. They each give every student the same answer. Paideia does the opposite: every artifact is derived from *your* folder — lecture notes, textbook chapter, HW, solutions, handwritten attempts — and accumulates permanently in plain markdown you can edit.

| Axis | Paideia | Typical edu-SaaS / LLM chat |
|-----|---------|------------------------------|
| Solution patterns (`P1..Pk`) | Extracted from *your course's* own solutions, citing your own files | Generic textbook list, or none |
| Drill priority | Weighted by *your professor's* HW emphasis (HW density = exam tier) | Fixed curriculum, or your own guesswork |
| Cheatsheet | Built from *your* `errors/log.md` — whatever you actually got wrong | Boilerplate from the syllabus |
| Per-course state across sessions | Permanent markdown + YAML, grows as you work | Conversation resets; paid tier for history |
| Editing an artifact you disagree with | Open the `.md` in any editor, save | Read-only UI |
| Carrying last semester's prep into next semester | Fork the course folder, edit deltas | Start over |
| Version history of your own understanding | `git log` / `git diff` any artifact | Not surfaced |
| Where the artifacts live | Your disk, as text | Remote DB, exportable only with paid tier |

The plugin uses Claude Code (which is a paid tool) to do the heavy lifting, but everything it produces lives on your disk as plain markdown. If you later switch to a different model runner, or pause your Claude Code subscription, the course-index, patterns, error log, weakmaps, and cheatsheets are all still yours to open, read, edit, and diff. The scaffold is the plugin; the study graph is yours.

By default, OCR goes through Claude's native vision inside your existing Claude Code session. If you'd rather the handwritten PDFs never leave the machine, `ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b` is a one-time ~6 GB download that flips every subsequent OCR pass to local Qwen3-VL inference. Either way, everything downstream — patterns, coverage, weakmaps, cheatsheets, the error log — is plain markdown on your disk.

---

## The load-bearing principle: HW density = exam probability

Most "study smart" advice tells you to hunt your blind spots. That is **backwards**. The professor has *already told you* where the exam points live — by assigning homework. Sections with heavy HW coverage are 🔥🔥 Exam-primary. Sections with zero HW are ⚪ Low-risk, not "hidden traps". The professor's omission is the strongest possible signal that the topic is off the exam.

Paideia's ranking is explicit about this, and every drill command honors it by default:

| Tier | HW count on section | Treatment | Share of mock-exam points |
|------|---------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 🔥🔥 Exam-primary | 3+ | Drill hardest | ≥70% |
| 🔥 Exam-likely | 2 | Drill next | ~25% |
| 🟡 Exam-possible | 1 | Warm-pass review | ≤5% |
| ⚪ Low-risk | 0 | Reference only | 0 |

`/paideia:quiz all`, `/paideia:mock`, `/paideia:hwmap hot` all weight output by this tiering. If you insist on drilling a ⚪ section, the plugin complies once and warns you that exam probability is low — your limited time is worth more than an imagined gotcha.

---

## The formation cycle, stage by stage

| Stage | What it does | Commands | Produces |
|-------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Encounter** | Read the professor's signal | `/paideia:ingest` | `converted/**/*.md` — every lecture, textbook chapter, HW, solution, as clean markdown |
| **Structure** | Extract the grammar of the course | `/paideia:analyze` | `course-index/{summary,patterns,coverage}.md` — topic tree, recurring solution patterns (P1..Pk), HW-density exam-tier ranking |
| **Practice** | Active recall weighted by what the professor actually tests | `/paideia:quiz`, `/paideia:twin`, `/paideia:blind`, `/paideia:chain`, `/paideia:mock` | `quizzes/`, `twins/`, `chain/`, `mock/` — problems you solve on paper |
| **Reflection** | Your hand-written work becomes a grade | `/paideia:grade` | `answers/converted/<name>.md` + `errors/log.md` — OCR via Claude vision (default), Ollama/Qwen3-VL, or Tesseract; then strategy-based grading |
| **Diagnosis** | Errors compressed into a priority-ranked weakness report | `/paideia:weakmap` | `weakmap/weakmap_<ts>.md` — append-only history |
| **Distillation** | One page, error-driven, printable | `/paideia:cheatsheet`, `/paideia:derive`, `/paideia:pattern` | `cheatsheet/final.md`, `derivations/<slug>.md` — reference only what you actually need |

Supporting: `/paideia:hwmap` surfaces HW-density exam-probability, `/paideia:init-course` bootstraps a fresh course folder.

## Install

### Prerequisites

**Required**

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) CLI
- Python 3.9+ (the plugin checks + offers to install its deps)
- A Unix-style shell (`bash` / `zsh`). The bootstrap + grade commands use heredocs, `mkdir -p`, `mktemp`, and subshell backgrounding — native Windows `cmd` / PowerShell isn't currently supported.
- **macOS**: `brew install poppler tesseract tesseract-lang`
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: `apt-get install poppler-utils tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-kor`
- **Windows**: use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install), then follow the Linux path inside the WSL shell. Git Bash works too if `poppler` and `tesseract` are on `PATH`.

**Optional — only if you want the `--ocr=ollama` mode (every page image stays on your machine)**

- `ollama` + the `qwen3-vl:8b` model (~6 GB). macOS: `brew install ollama`. Linux: see the [ollama install script](https://ollama.com/install.sh). Then `ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b`.

If you don't install Ollama, Paideia's default OCR engine is Claude's own vision — nothing extra to install, nothing extra to subscribe to beyond Claude Code itself.

### Install via Claude Code plugin marketplace

Run each line as a separate command inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/TaewoooPark/PAIDEIA.git
```

```
/plugin install paideia@paideia-marketplace
```

> The full `https://...` URL is deliberate — the `owner/repo` shorthand makes the CLI try SSH first, which fails if you don't have a GitHub SSH key registered. HTTPS always works.

After install, 14 slash commands become available under the `/paideia:` namespace.

### Per-course bootstrap

Open Claude Code inside the folder you want to use for this course, then run:

```
/paideia:init-course
```

This interactively:
1. Checks Python / poppler / tesseract deps and offers to install missing ones (ollama is only probed when you pick the `ollama` engine in step 3)
2. Asks for `COURSE_NAME`, `EXAM_DATE`, `EXAM_TYPE`, `USER_WEAK_ZONES`
3. Asks which OCR engine you want as the default: `claude` (native vision, no install), `ollama` (local Qwen3-VL, pulls the 6 GB model in the background), or `tesseract` (lightest, lowest fidelity)
4. Creates the directory skeleton (`materials/`, `converted/`, `course-index/`, `quizzes/`, `mock/`, `twins/`, `chain/`, `derivations/`, `cheatsheet/`, `weakmap/`, `answers/converted/`, `errors/`)
5. Writes `.course-meta` (carries `OCR_ENGINE`, read by `/paideia:grade`) and a project-level `CLAUDE.md`
6. Wires both a project-scoped statusline (`scripts/statusline.py`) **and** a `SessionStart` hook (`scripts/session_start.py`) in `.claude/settings.json`. The statusline shows `paideia · <COURSE> · D-N · <phase> · P<k> ↑` whenever you're inside the course folder; the hook prints a matching two-line reminder at the top of every new conversation so first-turn context is already primed
7. `git init` so your prep is versioned from the first keystroke

You can always override the OCR engine for a single grade call: `/paideia:grade --ocr=claude path/to/answer.pdf`.

---

## Course folder layout

After `/paideia:init-course`, your course folder looks like this:

```

├── twins/                           # /paideia:twin — same pattern, new surface
├── chain/                           # /paideia:chain — multi-pattern integration problems
├── derivations/                     # /paideia:derive — clean reference derivations

└── weakmap/                         # /paideia:weakmap — timestamped, append-only history
```

**Only two directories are yours to edit by hand:**
- `materials/` — drop source PDFs (or MDs) into the matching subfolder.
- `answers/` — drop hand-written scan PDFs into the root; the OCR'd markdown shows up under `answers/converted/`.

Everything else is produced by slash commands and should be treated as regenerable. Delete and rebuild whenever, `git log <dir>` to see your own progress over time, or point Obsidian at the whole folder as a vault.

---

## A reading tip: use Obsidian

Paideia writes everything as plain markdown with LaTeX math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`). You can read it in any editor, but **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)** is the natural choice:

- Renders `$...$` and `$$...$$` math via MathJax with zero configuration
- Backlinks let you click from `quizzes/q_<ts>.md` straight into the cited `converted/lectures/chN.md §K`
- The whole course folder is just a vault — point Obsidian at `~/courses/my-course`, and everything is a searchable graph
- Works entirely offline, free, local. Consistent with Paideia's philosophy: your notes, your disk, your tool

VS Code with a markdown-math extension works too. The terminal — even with a markdown preview — is bad for math; don't fight that.

## Full workflow — an example

### Phase 0 — once per course (15 minutes)

```bash
cp ~/textbooks/ch*.pdf      ~/courses/my-course/materials/textbook/
cp ~/lecture-notes/wk*.pdf  ~/courses/my-course/materials/lectures/
cp ~/hw/hw*.pdf             ~/courses/my-course/materials/homework/
cp ~/hw/hw*_sol.pdf         ~/courses/my-course/materials/solutions/
```

In Claude Code:

```
/paideia:ingest                     # every PDF → vision pipeline (parallel agents, LaTeX-faithful)
/paideia:analyze <weak-zone hints>  # build patterns + coverage + summary
/paideia:hwmap hot                  # surface 🔥🔥 exam-primary zones
```

### Phase 1 — diagnostic (40 minutes)

```
/paideia:quiz all 20                # broad diagnostic, 20 problems
# solve on paper (40 min), scan to answers/diagnostic.pdf
/paideia:grade                      # local qwen3-vl OCR + strategy grade
```

### Phase 2 — targeted drilling (bulk of your prep time)

```
/paideia:weakmap                    # priority-ranked weakness report
/paideia:blind hw3-p2               # strategy-only drill on a known problem
/paideia:twin hw3-p2                # variant with same pattern, new surface
/paideia:chain 3                    # multi-pattern integration problem
/paideia:quiz weakmap 5             # 5 problems targeting the latest weakmap
```

### Phase 3 — integration (~90 minutes)

```
/paideia:mock 90                    # full 90-min mock weighted by HW density
# solve on paper, scan, upload to answers/mock_<ts>.pdf
/paideia:grade                      # grade the mock
```

### Phase 4 — compression (60 minutes, night before exam)

```
/paideia:cheatsheet --pdf           # error-driven one-pager
/paideia:weakmap                    # review weak zones one more time
```

### Phase 5 — cool-down (10 minutes before exam)

```
/paideia:weakmap                    # top 3 only. Do not learn new things.
```

## Under the hood

### Ingest pipeline: vision for every PDF

`/paideia:ingest` routes every PDF in `materials/**` through the same vision pipeline. `pdfplumber` was tried first as a fast path for prose-heavy material (textbook, HW) and proved unreliable: even pages that *look* like plain prose silently word-salad as soon as they mix equations, figures, multi-column layouts, or margin notes. Rather than maintain a per-category heuristic with fallbacks we'd have to retune per course, we route everything uniformly.

| Source | Method |
|---|---|
| `materials/**/*.pdf` | Vision pipeline (parallel agents, LaTeX-faithful) |
| `materials/**/*.md` | Copy-through with provenance header |

How the pipeline runs: every page is rendered to PNG at `dpi=160`; every PNG is resized to ≤1800 px on the long edge **before any agent starts reading** (Claude's many-image requests hard-reject images >2000 px; 16:9 slides at dpi=160 blow past that unless you preempt the resize); then one parallel `general-purpose` agent is spawned per PDF, each of which reads its own pages *sequentially* (parallel batches trip the same dimension limit) and transcribes to LaTeX markdown. Output like `$$\hat H = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\partial_x^2 + V(x)$$` instead of `ℏ ∂ p2 ℏ 2 ∂ 2 p ̂`. A real 13-lecture, 208-page quantum mechanics course ran end-to-end with zero `[?]` markers.

Details in `plugins/paideia/skills/pdf/VISION.md`.

### Hand-writing OCR: three engines, you pick

The user does not type math into chat. They solve on paper, scan to PDF, drop the PDF into `answers/`, and run `/paideia:grade`. The plugin converts the scan to markdown via one of three engines, chosen per course (via `OCR_ENGINE` in `.course-meta`) and overridable per call (via `/paideia:grade --ocr=<engine>`):

| Engine | Default? | How it runs | When to pick it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude` | **Yes** | `pdftoppm` renders each page → Claude reads each PNG directly → synthesizes markdown in one pass. No extra model, no subprocess, nothing to install. | The out-of-the-box path. Strong on Korean + LaTeX; no model-load stall. |
| `ollama` | opt-in | `vision_ocr.py --engine=ollama` → local Qwen3-VL 8B with automatic tesseract fallback. | You want the page images to never leave the machine (not even to Anthropic). Requires `ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b` once (~6 GB). |
| `tesseract` | opt-in | `vision_ocr.py --engine=tesseract` → pytesseract `eng+kor` only. | Fastest and lightest; acceptable for typed scans; poor on hand-writing. |

Each engine writes `answers/converted/<stem>.md` with a `<!-- SOURCE: ... -->` / `<!-- TIER: ... -->` header comment so `/paideia:grade` can caveat low-confidence OCR.

Default choice (`claude`) is deliberately the path of least friction: anything that already ships with Claude Code is enough. The `ollama` engine exists for users who want a hard privacy boundary on the page images themselves, and `tesseract` exists as a reliable floor when nothing else is available.

### Strategy-based grading, not line-by-line

OCR noise in hand-written math makes strict algebraic grading useless — a single misread `∫` vs `∑` would cascade. More importantly, **pattern recognition is the actual exam bottleneck**, not arithmetic. The grader therefore checks three things on each problem:

1. **Pattern** — did the student pick the right Pk from `course-index/patterns.md`?
2. **Variables** — did they identify the right substitution / basis / index / contour?
3. **End-form** — does their final expression have the right shape (dimensions, asymptotics, structure)?

Errors get logged as YAML to `errors/log.md` with a typed classification (`pattern-missed | wrong-variable | wrong-end-form | algebraic | sign | definition`). This log is the seed for `/paideia:weakmap` and the *only* input to `/paideia:cheatsheet --pdf`.

### Patterns extracted from *your* solutions

`/paideia:analyze` doesn't ship a generic "calculus moves" list. It reads your course's actual solution manual, extracts recurring solution patterns, and labels them P1, P2, ... with worked instances that cite your own `converted/solutions/` files. The patterns are *your course's idioms*, not a textbook's. For a complex analysis course, P3 might be "closed contour + Jordan's lemma + residue at essential singularity." For a linear systems course, P3 might be "partial fractions + inverse Laplace with complex poles." Every discipline has its own moves; only the course itself reveals them.

### Append-only history

`weakmap/` never overwrites. Every `/paideia:weakmap` invocation produces `weakmap/weakmap_<ISO-timestamp>.md`. You can `git log weakmap/` and see exactly which weaknesses collapsed first, which ones persisted, which new ones emerged after the diagnostic mock. This is "`git diff` your own understanding over time" in practice.

### Statusline: where you are in the cycle, at a glance

`/paideia:init-course` writes a project-scoped `.claude/settings.json` that points Claude Code's statusline slot at `scripts/statusline.py`. The statusline shows:

```
paideia · <COURSE_NAME> · D-<days-to-exam> · <phase> · P<top-miss> ↑
```

- **`<phase>`** is derived from **activity** on disk (not a calendar, and not merely file existence), so it advances when you actually use the artifact, not when you seed an empty one:
  - `setup` — `course-index/patterns.md` doesn't exist yet → run `/paideia:ingest` + `/paideia:analyze`
  - `diag` — patterns exist, but `errors/log.md` has no graded entry yet → run `/paideia:quiz all 20`, solve on paper, then `/paideia:grade`
  - `drill` — quiz problems exist AND `errors/log.md` has at least one graded `- problem_id:` entry → cycle `/paideia:blind` · `/paideia:twin` · `/paideia:quiz weakmap`
  - `mock` — a mock-sourced entry has appeared in `errors/log.md` (i.e., you've actually graded a mock) → compress with `/paideia:cheatsheet --pdf`
  - `cram` — `cheatsheet/final.{md,pdf}` exists → taper, re-read the weakmap, stop learning new things
  - `cool` — `D-0` overrides everything (exam is today)
- **`<top-miss>`** is the most frequent `pattern:` tag from the latest `weakmap/weakmap_*.md` (falls back to `errors/log.md`). The `↑` is a reminder that this is the pattern to drill next.
- **Color** is a random neon shade, picked deterministically from `sha1(session_id)` — it stays stable within one session but rotates across sessions. Pure decoration; no information is color-encoded.
- **Silent fallback** — if the CWD has no `.course-meta`, the script outputs nothing, and Claude Code falls back to its default statusline. Safe to leave wired.

On top of the statusline, `/paideia:init-course` also wires a `SessionStart` hook (`scripts/session_start.py`, matcher `startup|resume`) that prints a matching two-line reminder — course name with D-N, current phase, and the top-miss pattern with a suggested next command — at the top of every new conversation. The hook and the statusline read the same `.course-meta` + `errors/log.md` + latest weakmap, so they agree; the hook just echoes the same signal inline in the prompt, where first-turn context tends to land before the eye hits the status bar. Both slots exit silently if the CWD has no `.course-meta`, so it's safe to leave wired when you `cd` elsewhere.

Under the hood, the statusline memoizes its output at `~/.cache/paideia/<sha1(cwd|session)>.json` and invalidates on the `mtime` of every file whose contents affect the display (`.course-meta`, `course-index/patterns.md`, `errors/log.md`, `cheatsheet/final.{md,pdf}`, newest `weakmap/mock/quizzes` file). Claude Code re-renders the statusline on every prompt; without the cache, a mature course folder with hundreds of weakmap entries would re-scan on every turn.

To disable the statusline for one course, delete or edit that course's `.claude/settings.json`. To disable globally, edit `~/.claude/settings.json` instead. To customize the format or colors, edit `plugins/paideia/scripts/statusline.py` — everything is in one file.

## Design convictions

1. **The terminal is bad for math.** Claude produces markdown files; you read them (ideally in Obsidian).
2. **Typing solutions is slow and error-prone.** You solve on paper, scan, and the plugin OCRs locally.
3. **OCR noise is inevitable.** So grading is strategy-based (pattern / variables / end-form), not line-by-line algebra. This is what the actual exam grader is evaluating anyway.
4. **Patterns must be extracted from *your* course's solutions** — not from a generic list. Every discipline has its own idioms; only the course itself reveals them.
5. **Your errors are the most valuable study signal** — more than the textbook, more than the lectures. The cheatsheet is generated from `errors/log.md`, not from the syllabus.
6. **HW density tells you the exam.** Your time is finite; spend it where the points are.
7. **Everything is yours to edit.** Patterns, weakmaps, cheatsheets, the error log — all plain markdown/YAML in your own git history. Disagree with `P3`? Rewrite it, and the next drill uses your edit. Fork a course folder from last semester into a new one and edit deltas. The plugin is a scaffold; the study graph is yours.

## FAQ

**Does this work for non-math courses?**
It's built around problem-pattern extraction, so it shines in quantitative disciplines: math, physics, EE, CS-theory, ML-theory, statistics, engineering. For history or literature it would still ingest and produce summaries, but the drill commands assume problems have solution patterns.

**Korean and English mixed materials?**
Yes. Ingestion and OCR are configured for `eng+kor`. Patterns and grading responses honor the language mix of your source materials.

**How is this different from just asking ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini to help me study?**
Per-course persistence. An LLM chat has no memory of the pattern you missed on HW2 two weeks ago, no ranking of which sections your professor actually emphasizes, no notion of "your typical error type." Paideia writes all of that to markdown files on your disk. A `/paideia:weakmap` today is informed by every `/paideia:grade` since the course began, because `errors/log.md` is append-only. A generic chat session, however smart, is a blank slate every time you open it.

**Can I edit the patterns / cheatsheet / weakmap if I disagree?**
Yes. That's the whole point of keeping them as plain markdown. If `P3` feels wrong, open `course-index/patterns.md` and rewrite it — subsequent drills will use your edit. If the cheatsheet emphasizes the wrong thing, trim it. The plugin is a scaffold; the study graph is yours to shape.

**Do I need Ollama / Qwen3-VL to use this?**
No. The default OCR engine is Claude's native vision — it uses the Claude Code session you're already in and needs no extra install. Ollama + `qwen3-vl:8b` is an opt-in path for users who want the page images to stay on their machine entirely (not even visible to Anthropic's servers during a grade call). `tesseract` is a third option for minimal-install setups or typed scans.

**What if my machine can't run `qwen3-vl:8b` even though I picked Ollama?**
The `vision_ocr.py` driver automatically falls back to tesseract `eng+kor` on any Ollama failure. You can also just set `OCR_ENGINE: claude` in `.course-meta` (or pass `--ocr=claude`) and skip Ollama entirely.

**Can I reuse the plugin across multiple courses?**
Yes — each course lives in its own folder with its own `.course-meta`, `course-index/`, `errors/log.md`, and `weakmap/`. Nothing is shared or polluted across courses. Open Claude Code inside whichever course folder you're working on.

**Can I trust an LLM to grade my work?**
Grading is strategy-based (pattern match, not algebra), the grader cites the pattern from `course-index/patterns.md`, and every grade writes a YAML entry you can audit in `errors/log.md`. If a grade is wrong, fix the YAML entry — the next `/paideia:weakmap` reflects the correction.

**Is my data private?**
Your PDFs, markdown, errors, and weakmaps all live in your local course folder — nothing is uploaded to any third-party service. The only network traffic the plugin itself generates depends on the OCR engine you pick: with `claude` (default), page images flow through your existing Claude Code session (i.e., whatever path your normal Claude Code conversation already takes — nothing new); with `ollama`, nothing leaves the machine after the one-time model download; with `tesseract`, nothing leaves the machine ever.
